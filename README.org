* libnetwork (docker) point-to-point network driver plugin

For efficient container-to-container networking a simple non-bridged veth pair
is sufficient. This docker network driver implements a point-to-point network
using a veth pair.

One application of this is to test bridging software so the ability to function
without IP addresses is a goal.
